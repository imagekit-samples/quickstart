This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). For the scope of this integration, we will focus on the app routers in `Next.js`. Please refer to [here](https://github.com/imagekit-developer/imagekit-next/tree/master/example/page-router) for page router.

## Add configuration

Create `.env.local` file and copy the content from `.env.example` into it. Replace `<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY>`, `<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT>` and  `<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY>` with actual values.
 
## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now let's run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
